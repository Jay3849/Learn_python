# We run a business which execute on every quarter of every month throughout year. Every time when we are working we work for 24 hours.
# When hours finished we calculate our productivity form total work. To calculate productivity we depends on season. If Itâ€™s winter then 
# productivity is highest 90% of total, if it is summer the productivity is 80% of total and when monsoon productivity is 85% of total.
# Same thing apply to attendance. As per season people are absent on work. During winter attendance is 98%. During summer attendance is
# 85% and during monsoon attendance is 70%. We have total 169 professionals more or less who work with us. Out of 126 are males and 
# remain are females at this time. Male productivity is 5% higher than female. Every hours productivity rate is 10 or any we adjust as
# per market. Now, we need to calculate total productivity of year. Our calculation work with given algorithm with number of male and 
# female professionals and productivity rate we provide.  



# 4 times month 
# 12 * 4 = 48 

# 1 session = 24 hours 

# productivity logic 
# 3 seasons

# winter = 90%


# summer = 80%

# monsoon = 85%

# male productivity is 5% higher than female 

# productivity rate = 10 

# attendence

# winter = 98%


# summer = 85%

# monsoon = 70%


# total working professionals = 169 

# males = 126

# females = 169 - 126 = 43 



# output = total productivity of year

# input = male professionals , female professionals, productivate rate
